# Rhino-Plugins
McNeel's Rhinoceros is a 3D modeling software widely used by architects and product designers. Its functionalities can be extended via various API provided by McNeel. This repository contains a variety of projects at intermediate stages of development.

### Oblique Transform

Oblique projection type of orthographic projection used for creating a pictorial drawing of an object, where the lines of sight are perpendicular to the plane of projection, and the object is rotated around one or more of its axes to reveal multiple sides. Unlike other forms of axonometric projections, oblique type allows for dimensionally accurate depiction of the object. It was used widely prior to 3D digital modeling. Today's 3D softwares, however, are inherently unable to produce this form of projection. This plugin enables users to temporarily transform their models to be viewed in this particular form of representation and restore it with a click of a button.
